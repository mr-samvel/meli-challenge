# LLM Usage Documentation

## Overview

This project was developed with assistance from Claude Code to improve efficiency and accelerate implementation of repetitive tasks.

## How Claude Code Was Used

### 1. Code Generation
- Generated boilerplate code for models, repositories, services, and controllers
- Created DTOs with static factory methods

### 2. Documentation
- Added JavaDoc to classes and methods
- Documented design patterns and architectural decisions
- Translated and improved architecture documentation

### 3. Testing
- Created tests from test requirements passed from the developer

## Integration Approach

Setup consisted in generating a [context file](../.claude/project-context.md) to guide the LLM. Then, Claude Code was used as a collaborative pair programmer:
1. Developer provided high-level requirements and design decisions
2. Claude Code implemented the code following established patterns
3. Developer reviewed and corrected when needed
4. Iterative refinement based on feedback
